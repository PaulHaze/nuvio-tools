# Sprint 11 — Shared title matching and review controls

**Status:** implemented; acceptance pending

## Goal

Make Sprint 07's title matching and Need a look controls reusable before building the text import
page. The editor keeps its current search, paste, Draft and Save behaviour. This sprint is a focused
refactor with its own regression audit.

The original Sprint 11 import brief is now split across this sprint,
[Sprint 12 — single-list import](./12_Import_Single_List_From_Text.md), and
[Sprint 13 — multiple-list import](./13_Import_Multiple_Lists_From_Text.md).
Collection export follows in [Sprint 14](./14_Nuvio_Collection_Export.md).
The import decisions agreed with the owner on 4 Oct 2026 carry forward into those briefs.

## Behaviour

- Search still offers Add, Added, In list and Restore, including Titles without a TMDB ID.
- Paste still matches in batches of 20, follows lookup continuations and retries transient per-line
  failures once at the end. A stopped request leaves completed additions in the editor's Draft.
- Need a look still offers candidates, a prefilled search for a no-match line, and Skip.
- Repeating a paste still reuses earlier choices and handles duplicates and restores correctly.
- Search and paste still change only the Draft. Only the editor's Save publishes those changes.

Shared controls must let the caller decide how an addition is committed. The editor adds to its Draft;
the future import page will await a save. A failed addition must leave its review line unresolved,
with an error and a way to retry. No import persistence is implemented here.

## Tasks

- [x] Extract the batch match loop from `components/editor/TitleDiscovery.tsx` into a shared client
      module. Accept parsed `PasteLine[]`, an abort signal and progress/result callbacks. Preserve
      batches of 20, lookup continuations, result-to-line association and the existing one-time retry.
      Keep enough completed-result information for callers to report a stopped run
- [x] Extract shared candidate lookup and identity handling. Preserve the TMDB/type-to-IMDb cache,
      recognition of active and Removed Titles, and the distinction between a missing IMDb ID and a
      transient lookup failure
- [x] Extract the search, candidate grid and Need a look controls into shared components. Let the
      caller supply its current Titles and an addition callback that may be synchronous or asynchronous;
      await success before resolving a row. Preserve pending/error states and prevent repeated clicks
- [x] Keep remembered line-to-IMDb choices scoped to the editor/list that owns them. Sharing controls
      must not make one list's review choices resolve another list's lines
- [x] Rewire `TitleDiscovery.tsx` to the shared pieces. Preserve summaries, repeat-paste reconciliation,
      busy tracking, abort handling and the editor's current button labels
- [x] Regression tests for the extracted match loop: multiple batches, lookup continuation, one-time
      per-line retry, fatal request failure after a completed batch, and abort
- [x] Regression checks for review: candidate Add and Skip, prefilled no-match search, duplicate/restore
      identity, remembered choices on repeat paste, and an asynchronous addition failing without
      resolving the row. Use component tests where practical and record browser checks for UI paths

## Done when

- The editor imports the shared matching and review pieces rather than keeping a second implementation
- Search, repeated paste, Need a look, duplicates and restores behave as before
- A stopped match preserves completed Draft additions; unmounting stops outstanding client work
- A caller can await an addition before the shared review control marks its line resolved
- `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` and `pnpm lint:check` pass

## Not in this sprint

- The `/import` page, text format validation or file upload
- Creating or saving lists from import results
- Changes to TMDB confidence rules, endpoint contracts or Workers request budgets
- Nuvio collection export

## Implementation and verification

The shared client modules in `src/client/` own JSON requests, candidate identity
lookup and the match loop. `matchLines` receives parsed lines, an abort signal,
and progress/result callbacks. It preserves batches of 20, continuation lookups,
and a single retry pass for transient line failures. A `MatchStopped` error
contains settled line/result pairs when a later request fails or is aborted.
A line counts as settled only after its result callback succeeds, so a caller
that saves inside the callback is never told a failed save completed.
Lookup caches distinguish a missing IMDb ID from a retryable request failure.

`src/components/titles/TitleControls.tsx` exports Search, Candidates and
NeedALook. Callers supply active and Removed Titles, optional new-ID labels,
and an addition callback returning either a status or a promise. Candidate Add
awaits that callback before resolving review. Each candidate grid runs one
addition at a time. While it runs, the grid's other candidates, its search box
and its row's Skip are blocked. This also applies to the editor's main Search
panel, which previously blocked only the clicked candidate; the owner accepted
the stricter lock after the Sprint 11 audit. Need a look also runs one addition
at a time across its rows, so repeated lines offering the same candidate cannot
add it twice concurrently. It reports rows by object identity, not position;
owners replace a resolved row and ignore rows no longer in their review. A
rejected addition shows an error and enables Add again. The editor also blocks
starting a new paste while an addition is pending, preserving the current
review rows.

`TitleDiscovery` retains its Draft-specific summaries, reconciliation and
instance-local line-to-IMDb choices. It imports the shared controls and loop;
there is no second matching or candidate implementation in the editor. Its
additions still use the existing Draft callback, and only Save sends a list
write. Outstanding matching, searches and lookups abort on unmount.

Regression tests cover multiple batches and line association, lookup
continuations, one-time retry, fatal failure after a completed batch, abort,
identity caching and missing/transient IMDb lookups. React component tests use
happy-dom to exercise candidate Add/Skip, no-match search prefilling, pending
states, asynchronous failure and retry, IMDb-only active/Removed labels,
repeat-paste duplicates and restores, remembered-choice isolation between
owners, and lookup cancellation on unmount.

Browser checks on 4 Oct 2026 used a temporary local fixture harness rendering
the actual Editor and shared controls, with intercepted API responses:

- IMDb-only saved and Removed Titles showed In list and Restore; new candidates
  showed Add and then ✓ Added.
- Candidate Add and Skip worked in Need a look, and a no-match search was
  prefilled with the pasted name.
- Repeated paste reused a no-match search choice and counted existing ambiguous
  candidates as duplicates. Removing that chosen Title and repeating the paste
  restored it, leaving no unresolved rows.
- The asynchronous caller kept its row unresolved while adding, disabled Add
  and Skip, showed its simulated save error, and resolved only after retry
  succeeded.
- Search and paste sent no list writes before Save. Save used the existing
  confirmation and cleared the editor's unsaved changes after its mocked write.

The fixture route, component and temporary local authentication exemption were
removed after these checks. These are mocked browser UI checks; live TMDB,
real storage persistence, Workers and Nuvio acceptance were not exercised.

Verification: `pnpm test` (151 tests) and `pnpm build` pass. The full
`pnpm lint:check` is blocked by formatting in an independently modified
`docs/movie_lists/midnight_movies.md`, which is preserved outside this sprint
commit. Sprint-owned files pass Prettier and source ESLint.
Astro check reports only the pre-existing `Editor.tsx` `returnValue` deprecation
hint. Independent Astra audit and owner acceptance remain pending.
