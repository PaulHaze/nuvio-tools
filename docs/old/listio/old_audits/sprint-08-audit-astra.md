> **Superseded (2026-10-04):** this audit covers the Cloudflare Access runbook, which was dropped in favour of HTTP Basic Auth in the app ([ADR 0006](../adr/0006-basic-auth-instead-of-cloudflare-access.md), commit `af95a52`). Its findings no longer apply.

## Executive summary

The commit completes the documentation portion of Sprint 08: it adds a usable dashboard runbook, links it from the README, and accurately records outstanding setup and acceptance work. All original tasks and acceptance criteria are preserved. No material defect was found in the documented policy configuration or its integration with the committed routes.

The sprint itself remains incomplete. The committed implementation record explicitly says that the required Access applications have not been configured or inspected. This is a confirmed missing implementation step, not merely an absence of runtime test evidence. Actual live protection and Nuvio behavior remain unverified; this audit does not claim to have observed an exposed live deployment. The critical category follows the audit skill's rule for unmet mandatory requirements.

## Critical findings

### [Critical 1] Required dashboard Access applications remain unconfigured

**Location:** `docs/sprints/08_Cloudflare_Access.md:27-31`; corroborated by `docs/cloudflare-access.md:10-15`.  
**Task requirement:** Create the free Zero Trust Access application on the Worker hostname with only Paul's email allowed, create the separate `/addon/*` Bypass application, and confirm `/api/*` coverage. The required outcome is that only Paul can use the UI/API while Nuvio can reach the addon without login.  
**Evidence:** The sprint record states that dashboard applications have not been configured or inspected, leaves the first three tasks unchecked at lines 11–13, and identifies the missing authenticated dashboard/Access-management capability plus unconfirmed hostname and email. The complete patch changes only four Markdown files. The unchanged `wrangler.jsonc:1-14` defines the Worker and KV binding, but does not provision these dashboard applications. The application intentionally depends on Access for authentication (`docs/adr/0002-astro-on-cloudflare.md:3`); for example, `src/pages/api/lists/index.ts:7-29` validates and processes list creation without an application-level identity check.  
**Trigger and impact:** If the Worker is served on an enabled hostname before the main Access policy is configured, direct UI/API requests reach the application without the required Paul-only identity gate. If only the main policy is later installed without the addon exception, Nuvio requests can encounter an interactive login it cannot complete. These are consequences of leaving the explicitly required configuration incomplete, not observed live failures. The runbook alone cannot deliver Sprint 08's goal or establish completion.  
**Recommendation:** Confirm the production hostname and Paul's exact login email, obtain authorized dashboard or equivalent Access-management access, then save and inspect both documented applications. Verify all enabled hostnames, main-application API coverage, private-session login/denial behavior, unauthenticated addon loading in Nuvio, and wrong-secret JSON 404s. Record the results in the sprint file before declaring the sprint complete. No application authentication rewrite is required by this finding.

## Validation performed

- Read the full parent-to-target patch and both versions of the complete canonical sprint specification. Only README, the new runbook, the sprint file, and the sprint index changed. No acceptance requirement was weakened or deleted.
- Inspected committed Worker configuration, addon route handlers and helper, list-creation route and validation helper, addon route tests, Vitest configuration, and the referenced authentication ADR. The documented empty-object POST probe returns before list creation; addon routes return CORS-enabled JSON and validate the secret before storage access.
- `rtk proxy git diff --check 362237a2a31f0cdfaab7f99ac39551d6689e0ea6 e32369b253c71ab18f63724b04af00e1552c4e8c --` — passed.
- `rtk pnpm exec prettier --check README.md docs/cloudflare-access.md docs/sprints/08_Cloudflare_Access.md docs/sprints/README.md` — passed. Working-tree content matched the target commit for these checks.
- `rtk pnpm exec vitest run test/addon-routes.test.ts` — implementation handoff and committed sprint record report four passing tests. Not rerun during this audit: the commit only changes documentation, the relevant test/handler code was inspected, and no new failure or code change warranted repetition. Tests call handlers directly with mocked Worker bindings; they cannot validate Access configuration or Nuvio's live client behavior.
- Broader tests, type checking and production build — not run; no source/configuration changed and these checks cannot resolve the missing dashboard setup.
- Cross-checked the runbook against official Cloudflare documentation. Hostname/path applications support Workers hostnames ([Access for Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cloudflare-access/)); an empty path covers the hostname and more-specific paths take precedence ([application paths](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/app-paths/)); Bypass/Everyone and alternative Include rules match the runbook ([Access policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)). These checks support the instructions, not the state of Paul's account.
- Dashboard inspection, cookie-free live requests, private-browser identity checks and Nuvio installation/loading — not performed. The implementation record identifies unavailable authenticated dashboard/Access-management capability and unconfirmed hostname/email. This audit did not inspect credentials or attempt configuration changes.

## Residual risks

- The actual account's Access application inventory, identity provider, Free-plan selection and all enabled production/preview hostnames remain unverified. No independent live exposure claim is made.
- After setup, successful Paul login, denial of another verified identity, API protection, absence of unintended alternate-hostname access, and addon Bypass precedence still require the documented live checks.
- Real Nuvio manifest/catalog loading, pagination, CORS and wrong-secret behavior through Cloudflare remain pending. Passing local handler tests does not establish these outcomes.

## Final verdict

**FAIL — Sprint 08 is not complete.** The documentation requirement is satisfied and its pending status is accurate, but the mandatory dashboard configuration has explicitly not been performed. Complete that external setup and record the live acceptance results before treating the sprint as finished. No source, configuration, or implementation documentation was changed by this audit.
